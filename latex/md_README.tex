This program is an employee management system with \mbox{\hyperlink{classEmployee}{Employee}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classSupervisor}{Supervisor}}, and \mbox{\hyperlink{classOfficer}{Officer}} classes. It stores and displays employee details, calculates pay, and anniversary information.

Main.\+cpp tests the constructors of each class and prints the employee data.

I documented the code and practiced using Doxygen with this program outline.
